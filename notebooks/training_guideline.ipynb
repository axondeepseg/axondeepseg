The default ranges of transformations are:\n",
    "- **Shifing**: Random horizontal and vertical shifting between 0 and 10% of the patch size, sampled from a uniform distribution.\n",
    "- **Rotation**: Random rotation, angle between 5 and 89 degrees, sampled from a uniform distribution.\n",
    "- **Rescaling**: Random rescaling of a randomly sampled factor between 1/1.2 and 1.2.\n",
    "- **Flipping**: Random fipping: vertical fipping or horizontal fipping.\n",
    "- **Blurring**: Gaussian blur with the standard deviation of the gaussian kernel being uniformly sampled between 0 and 4.\n",
