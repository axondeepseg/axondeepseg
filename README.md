# AxonDeepSeg

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neuropoly/axondeepseg/master?filepath=notebooks%2Fgetting_started.ipynb)

Segment axon and myelin from microscopy data using deep learning. Written in Python. Using the TensorFlow framework.
Based on a convolutional neural network architecture. Pixels are classified as either axon, myelin or background.
