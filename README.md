Segment axon and myelin from microscopy data using deep learning. Written in Python. Using the TensorFlow framework.
Based on a convolutional neural network architecture. Pixels are classified as either axon, myelin or background.

For more information, see the [documentation website](http://axondeepseg.readthedocs.io/).
